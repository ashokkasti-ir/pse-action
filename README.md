# Pipeline Security Engine

In recent years, there have been several high-profile security breaches that have exploited vulnerabilities in build pipelines. These breaches have exposed sensitive data, such as:

- Data exfiltration
- Code injection
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Supply chain attacks
- Intellectual Property


Recent pipeline compromises like 3CX, Kaseya, CircleCI, SolarWinds, CodeCov, and others have highlighted the need for securing the build pipeline.

Pipeline Security Engine  provides detailed analysis and control of all the network transactions done by software builds. PSE deployments can be used to protect against such threats.
